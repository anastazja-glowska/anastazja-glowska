Java Developer with  2 years of
 experience in developing and maintaining backend 
services using Java and Spring Boot. My main responsibilities
 include implementing business logic, designing and securing
 REST APIs, fixing bugs, and improving application
performance and reliability to support stable production
systems.I have hands-on experience with databases, caching,
 authentication, and automated testing, and I focus on 
delivering solutions that meet business requirements, 
ensure system availability, and provide measurable value to
 users. In addition to professional work, I have developed
 independent projects, including a game application
