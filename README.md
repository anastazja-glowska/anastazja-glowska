# 👋 Hi, I’m Anastazja – Java Developer

📌 BLOG: https://anastazjaglowska.pl/


I am a Java Backend Developer with commercial experience building scalable backend systems using Java, Spring Boot, and modern cloud-ready technologies. I specialize in designing secure REST APIs, implementing business logic, and delivering production-ready services that ensure reliability, performance, and measurable business value.

In my current role, I develop and maintain backend services that support stable production environments, working with technologies such as Spring Boot, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, and AWS. My responsibilities include API design and security (JWT), integration with external systems, automated background processing, performance optimization, and implementing comprehensive unit and integration testing strategies using JUnit, Mockito, WireMock, and Testcontainers. I also contribute to containerized deployments using Docker and support event-driven and microservices architectures.

In addition to professional work, I actively develop independent end-to-end backend projects, including a game application used by over 90 users, demonstrating strong ownership, full lifecycle development experience, and the ability to design, build, and deploy production-style systems independently.
